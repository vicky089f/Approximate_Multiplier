# Approximate_Multiplier
Dadda multiplier using half adders, full adders, and approximate 4:2 compressors

## Abstract
Multiplication, a core operation in all digital signal processing algorithms, consumes a tremendous amount of power. But DSP applications are immune to a certain amount of error since human eyes have an inherent inability to detect such minor errors. This enables us to replace the exact computations with inexact computations. Hence, by introducing inaccurate computations in the multiplier, it can be optimized to save area and power consumption for an unnoticeable drop in accuracy.
